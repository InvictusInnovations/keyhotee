Intentionally constructing transactions that a wallet would not build:
   - withdraw negative amount
   - deposit negative amount
   - deposit without withdraw or issuance
   - negative asset issuance
   - name reg without fee
   - delegate reg without fee
   - asset reg without fee
   - invalid votes (missing or to non-delegates)
   - vote that would give a delegate more than (1/BTS_BLOCKCHAIN_NUM_DELEGATES) fraction of the votes
