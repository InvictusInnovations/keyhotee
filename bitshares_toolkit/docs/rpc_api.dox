RPC implementation internals
============================

Code Generation Overview
------------------------
The RPC API is defined by a set of JSON files in `libraries/api`

- `blockchain_api.json`
- `wallet_api.json`
- `network_api.json`

These files describe each RPC method, providing enough information to generate help,
the C++ method signature, a C++ RPC client, and a C++ RPC server.

From those files, it generates:
- `bts/api/common_api.hpp`: the pure virtual interface listing each of the methods listed in the
  JSON files.
- `bts/rpc_stubs/common_api_client.hpp` and `bts/rpc_stubs/common_api_client.hpp`:  a C++ 
  implementation of the client-side RPC API.  This code implements the common_api interface
  for talking to an out-of-process bitshares_client.  This code is used by `bts::rpc::rpc_client`,
  which derives from the client stub class and adds a few functions to establish the RPC 
  network connection.
- `bts/rpc_stubs/common_api_server.hpp` and `bts/rpc_stubs/common_api_server.hpp`:  implements
  the server side of the RPC interface.  The generated code takes care of converting the 
  method arguments from JSON to the native C++ types, validating the parameters, dispatching
  to native method in `bts::client::client`, and then converting the result back to JSON.
  This code is used by `bts::rpc::rpc_server`, which derives from the server stub class 
  and adds methods to accept RPC and HTTP-RPC connections.

Implementing a new method
-------------------------
To add a new function to the JSON-RPC API.  I'll walk through the call I'm working on now,
`network_set_allowed_peers`.  The logic is already implemented in `bts::net::node` as 
`void set_allowed_peers(const std::vector<node_id_t>& allowed_peers)`.
1. Implement the C++ call in `bts::client::client`.  All RPC methods must be implemented in 
   client with the same name as they have in JSON-RPC, so this method will add the 
   `network_` prefix and delegate the call to the node.  You only need to add the 
   implementation in the .cpp file.  The method prototype in the header will be generated
   from the JSON.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
void client::network_set_allowed_peers(const std::vector<bts::net::node_id_t>& allowed_peers)
{
  my->_p2p_node->set_allowed_peers(allowed_peers);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Add the function to the appropriate JSON file.  Since this is a network function, it goes
   in `network_api.json`.  Down in the `methods` section, add a method description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.json}
{
  "method_name": "network_set_allowed_peers",
  "description": "Sets the list of peers this node is allowed to connect to",
  "return_type": "void",
  "parameters" : 
    [
      { 
        "name" : "allowed_peers", 
        "type" : "node_id_list", 
        "description" : "the list of allowable peers"
      }
    ],
  "prerequisites" : ["json_authenticated"],
  "detailed_description" : "This function sets the list of peers we're allowed to connect to. It is used during testing to force network splits or other weird topologies."
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Some notes on the method description: 
   - `description` should be a short one-liner, `detailed_description` (if present) should be a 
     longer description that will be appended to the short `description` when we generate 
     long-form help messages.
   - types like `return_type` and the `type` field for each parameter can be one of the predefined types 
     the generator knows about, or one of the types defined in the `types` section of the json file.
     The default types are:
     - `void` (only used for return values, a method that takes no parameters just has an empty parameter list)
     - `int16_t`
     - `uint16_t`
     - `int32_t`
     - `uint32_t`
     - `int64_t`
     - `uint64_t`
     - `std::string`
     - `json_variant`, which maps to `fc::variant`
     - `json_object`, which maps to `fc::variant_object`
     - `json_variant_list`, which maps to `fc::variants`
     - `json_object_list`, which maps to `std::vector<fc::variant_object>`
   - `prerequisites` can be a list containing one or more of:
     - `"no_prerequisites"`
     - `"json_authenticated"`
     - `"wallet_open"`
     - `"wallet_unlocked"`
     - `"connected_to_network"`
   - Since this is the first method to need the type `node_id_list`, we need to define it.  In C++, it's
     a vector of `bts::net::node_id_t`, and we don't know anything about those either.  So first, let's
     define a `node_id` type to the JSON generator.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.json}
{
  "type_name" : "node_id",
  "cpp_parameter_type" : "const bts::net::node_id_t&",
  "cpp_return_type" : "bts::net::node_id_t",
  "cpp_include_file" : "bts/net/node.hpp",
  "default_example" : "TODO"
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     A few notes on this:
     - the `type_name` should be something that makes sense to display in our API help.  So prefer
       names like `node_id_list` to `std::vector<bts::net::node_id_t>`.
     - `cpp_parameter_type` is how objects of this type are passed as a parameter to functions.  
       usually this is by const reference to larger objects, or by value for integer types.
     - `cpp_return_type` is the type as it appers as a return value, or for instantiating on
       the stack.  Usually just the type name.
     - `cpp_include_file` - if you provide this, it will make sure this file is included in any
       generated files that reference this type.
     - `default_example` is an object of that type, in JSON form, that will be used in generating
       example calls in the documentation.

     Now that the base type is defined, I need to define what a list of that type looks like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.json}
{
  "type_name" : "node_id_list",
  "container_type" : "array",
  "contained_type" : "node_id",
  "default_example" : "TODO"      
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     A few notes on this:
     - `container_type` can be `"array"` or `"dictionary"`.  
       - `array` maps to `std::vector` and requires a `contained_type`
       - `dictionary` maps to `std::map`, and requires a `key_type` and `value_type`
2. Build.  

Command-Line Interface Prompting and Special Parameter Types
------------------------------------------------------------
The command line interface (CLI) will automatically prompt for missing required parameters. For example, if the user
types the command "unlock", the CLI will prompt the user to enter the required parameters "timeout" and "passphrase".
A CLI command can be aborted during prompted entry by pressing <ENTER> without entering any data.

Currently the command-line interface recoognizes these special types when prompting for parameters:
  
- passphrase: this type should be used for any password that shouldn't be echoed to the console during prompted entry.
- new_passphrase: this type should be used for any command that requires the user to specify a "new" password. In this case,
                  the CLI will not echo the password AND it will prompt for the password twice to verify it's accurate entry.

RPC method parameter conventions
--------------------------------
- <> = required parameter
- [] = optional parameter
- The last positional parameter is an optional parameter dictionary(name/value pairs).

We will support bitcoin-compatible names for the most useful existing bitcoin methods. For example, sendtoaddress, etc.

For bitshares-specific API methods, we will use underscores to separate the words in the method name(e.g. wallet_send_to_account). 

In addition to using underscores, we have the following namespace prefixes for our new RPC methods:

- wallet_
- blockchain_
- p2p_

DACs can further extend the basic prefix namespace. For example, the DNS DAC will add prefixes like:

- dns_blockchain_
- dns_wallet_
- dns_

### Name queries	
- wallet_get_names [start_name] [count]: returns all names that we have registered
- wallet_get_delegates [start_name] [count]: returns all delegates that we have registered
	
- blockchain_get_names [start_name] [count]: returns all names registered in blockchain
- blockchain_get_delegates [start_rank] [count]: return all delegates registered in blockchain, ranked by net vote for and against. This is filtered version of blockchain_get_names.    
	
send_account: extended public key you give to someone. This generates a series 
receive_account: extended private key associated with the send_account you give to someone. 

contact (not an index)
- set of send_accounts
- set of corresponding receive_accounts

account (has a logical name)
invoice: this is a send to somewhere at the user level (user generates these)
payment: is a one-time address generated by the system (not manipulated by user)
	  
payment_id: hash of a payment (hash of one-time signed_transaction)	  

invoice
- memo
- last_payment_index
  
  
wallet_account_record: this is the "base" type for send and receive accounts (it can represent either).
  - name: name of account, must be unique.  
  - account_index: index into wallet master key (generates keys for this account). A negative index indicates it is a send account.  
  - extended_public_key: generated public key (created from account_index). This is redundant, but it allows us to you to use the public keys without having to unlock the wallet again. In the case of send accounts, it is required because we can't generate this public key (it's someone else's key).
  - transaction_history: any transaction that references keys from this account.
  - map<invoice_index,invoice> invoices
    --a negative invoice_index is used whenever we have an imported key (key can't be generated from index)
  
invoice_summary
- map<payment_id, signed_transaction>
- invoice_index
- last_payment_index

wallet_send_to_address <to_address> [from_account_name] [flags]: does bitcoin support some memo here?
  returns transaction_id
wallet_send_to_account <to_account_name> [from_account_name] [flags] [invoice_memo]: pays an invoice on an account
  returns invoice_summary
flags: BROADCAST: sign and broadcast
       SIGN: sign only
	   UNSIGNED: do nothing extra

wallet_sign_transaction <transaction> (<array of address> | ANY REQUIRED | ALL_REQUIRED)
ANY_REQUIRED: sign with any key required by the transactions that we control.
ALL_REQUIRED: like ANY_REQUIRED must only update the transaction if we can make the transaction valid. Throws an error if we don't have all the needed keys.
Default is ANY_REQUIRED.

//DEPRECATE wallet_get_missing_signatures <transaction>: returns a list of signatures that haven't yet been added to transaction. These are required to broadcast a valid transaction.

wallet_add_receive_account <account_name> -> extended_public_key
-note: name must be unique
wallet_add_send_account <account_name> <extended_public_key>

wallet_get_invoice <account_name> <invoice_index> -> returns invoice_summary
wallet_rename_account <old_account> <new_account> 
-can thrown an error if old_account doesn't exist or new_account exists
-account names must be unique
wallet_delete_account <account_name>
backupwallet <destination_file>

  
## wallet contacts: Contact is an authorized contact in the keyhotee-sense (a friend). A contact enables to you to send money to someone.
--friend's name
-friend's contact_number: index into contact extended_key array in wallet. We use the index to generate the contact's extended key to generate more extended keys for payments. A payment consist of a number of tranfers to different addresses.

wallet account: is a group of incoming and outgoing payments that can generate a "balance". The account represent a set of keys you control (you have private keys).

-extended_public_key (optional, used for sending)
--last_rece

hkey_index: contact#,payment#,address#

Address is hash of a public key. Internally all addresses are referenced by an hkey_index (address_index/address_position/address_location/address_indices?).

account number 


address is a destination for money (this will replace "account" in the existing code). It's a condition object (multiple keys with conditionals plus potentially a password).

public_key_id_type is a hash of a public key (this will replace "address" in the existing code)

To be implemented: support for bitcoin-styles accounts. These work like traditional accounting accounts.

Non-bitcoin APIs
----------------

### Kehotee-based API methods

### Mail
1) mail inbox versus IM delivery display
2) mail: to/from/cc/body/attachments
3)

### Friend net functionality
Each client knows a set of friends to which they can directly connect via IP address. Exchanges between direct-connected friend peers often don't need to be broadcast to the general network (for example, instant messages and email exchanged between two connected friends). 


### Key exchange and IP address updating
Each client in a friend relationship is also told how to generate a set of deterministic keys that can be used to transfer money to the other client. These keys will also be used to prove/verify the identity of both parities when they connect up. The clients should also be able to send updated IP addresses to each other. So a client whose IP address has changed can still contact a friend, prove its identity via its key, then supply one or more updated IP addresses where it can be reached in the future. Clients can keep track of what IP their friend has for them, so that they could update friends automatically when their IP changes. Tracking is necessary since all friends might not be online to connect to at the time the IP address changes. We might want to periodically attempt to contact out-of-date friends until we successfully update them with our current IP address (probably should be user-configuratable on how often this is done). One possibility might be to try to contact friends with the updated IP whenever the client starts up and goes online.

### Avoiding disjoint subnets
Friends can also be peers in the general network, but we need to be sure that this preference can't somehow isolate to a standalone subnetwork. The simplest way to avoid this is to have a separate required/allowed count for standard peers and friend peers.

Also, what prevents this from happening normally in a non-darknet scenario? Solution: if no blocks are being received by a peer, we need to randomly disconnect existing peers and try new ones from the peer database.

IP addresses of friend peers won't be shared during peer list broadcasting.

### Friend-related API methods

friend_request <keyhoteeID|public_key>: initiates a request to establish a friend relationship with someone who holds this key.
* This is a broadcast message to the whole network that is used to negotiate direct connections.
* Receiving client needs to ask receiving user to authorize the request.
* Sender needs to be notified when receiver accepts or rejects the friend request.
  
add_friend KeyhoteeID ip key //potentially/optionally other fields in KH contact record as well
* This allows adding an existing friend without having to re-authorize the friend. It can only be done to a KH profile that matches the original friend_request (to enable this we would need to be sure that we can regenerate the extended public that key we shared with them, or else import that key, possibly as another parameter to this command).

set_peer_count: set number of regular (non-friend) peers to establish connection to
set_friend_peer_count: set number of friend peers to establish connections to
connect_friend KeyhoteeID: connect to a specific friend. Does this replace one of the automatically connected friends or is it a connection that is not considered in the friend peer count? 

Could even specify a set of friend peers to connect to (perhaps creating a grouping of contacts). This would be similar to the account-address paradigm. Such groupings could be shared within the group, enabling the creation of a "friend-only" network. This could also be used to improve updating of IP addresses, since this would allow friends to share the IP updates of other friends.



Using KeyhoteeID versus DisplayName?

Need to be notified when user has accepted/rejected authorize request. 
After rejection is acknowledged, I guess we clear the requesting state back to normal.

Friend net Data Model (client holds this data)
----------------------------------------------
KeyhoteeID -> extended_public_key_of_friend, ip_addresses_of_friend
              extended_public_key_shared_with_this_friend, ip_addresses_shared_with_this_friend
