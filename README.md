BitShares  Development Toolkit
===============================

The BitShares development toolkit is a set of libraries used to facilitate
the development of Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs).  It provides
a framework upon which new DACs can be developed based upon a common 
architecture.  

Build Instructions
------------------

BitShares Toolkit uses git submodules for managing certain external dependencies. Before
you can build you will need to fetch the submodules with the following commands:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cmake .
    make

Different platforms have different steps for handling dependencies, if you 
would like to build on OS X see BUILD_OSX.md
